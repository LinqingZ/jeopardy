# jeopardy

this is a class project of building the jeopardy game from scratch

### 1. Getting started

This project is maintained using Git version control system. To obtain a copy of files, or contribute to the project, use git commands. [video demonstration](https://youtu.be/a88o1bEFeCU) 

Once you have a copy, go into the `src` folder and install node dependencies to operate the backend.

Because we are using GitHub to store this project, please note that you will need to fork a copy of this project to your account before you make pull requests. When you're ready to contribute your changes, create a pull request. 

##### Starting localhost server

You'll need to virtually mimic the environment of running backend and frontend separately so you'll have two terminal windows open, one for backend and one for frontend.

**Start backend** 

From the `src` folder, run `node server.js`

**Start frontend**

From the `src/ui` folder, run a local server. If you have python3 then you can run `python3 -m http.server 8080` to run your app on port 8080. Note that your backend and frontend will need to be on separate port numbers to operate simultaneously.

### 2. Project goals

The documentation outlining goals for the project can be found in the `design_docs` folder.
